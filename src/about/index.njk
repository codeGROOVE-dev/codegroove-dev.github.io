          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0; font-size: 24px; font-weight: 700; color: #333;">STARTED AT GOOGLE. FINISHED HERE.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">Ready to Review started as a prototype within Google's developer experience team. The triage automation ideas eventually shipped as <a href="https://github.com/google/triage-party" style="color: #333; text-decoration: underline;">Triage Party</a>, but the turn-based notification system—the piece that actually solves review latency—needed more than 20% time. So we built it properly.</p>

        <p><strong>Thomas Stromberg</strong> — 30 years in open source. Formerly with Google, Kubernetes, Chainguard, and Equinix. Led engineering teams as both technical lead and manager.</p>
        <p>Based in Chapel Hill, NC. Started codeGROOVE after being tired of slow code reviews.</p>

        <p><strong>Nugget</strong> — Chief Dog Officer. Responsible for perimeter security (barking at suspicious delivery drivers), mandatory morale breaks (walk time is non-negotiable), and reminding the team that no bug is too difficult to solve after sniffing around the block.</p>

    <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

    <p>Code review latency is the invisible tax on engineering velocity. A 20-person team loses $1M/year in wait time. Engineers get blocked, context-switch, lose flow state. The best ones leave.</p>

    <p>We've lived this problem at scale—from 2-person startups to Google-sized orgs. We know what works: intelligent assignment, turn-based tracking, zero-friction notifications. The tools existed in fragments. We're building them properly.</p>

    <h2>WHAT WE OFFER</h2>

    <p><strong><a href="/products/ready-to-review/">Ready to Review</a></strong> — 20X faster code reviews through intelligent assignment and turn-based tracking.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="/opensource/">Open Source</a></strong> — Free forever for OSS projects. 10% of profits reinvested in the ecosystem.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="/security/">Security-First</a></strong> — Zero trust architecture. Built by ex-Google/Chainguard security engineers.</p>
