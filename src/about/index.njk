          <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">Ready to Review started as a prototype within Google's developer experience team. The triage automation ideas eventually shipped as <a href="https://github.com/google/triage-party" style="color: #333; text-decoration: underline;">Triage Party</a>, but the turn-based notification system—the piece that actually solves review latency—needed more than 20% time. So we built it properly.</p>

    <h2>WHY WE EXIST</h2>

    <p>Code review latency is the invisible tax on engineering velocity. A 20-person team loses $1M/year in wait time. Engineers get blocked, context-switch, lose flow state. The best ones leave.</p>

    <p>We've lived this problem at scale—from 2-person startups to Google-sized orgs. We know what works: intelligent assignment, turn-based tracking, zero-friction notifications. The tools existed in fragments. We're building them properly.</p>

    <h2>OPEN SOURCE FIRST</h2>

    <p>Our core tools are open source and free forever for OSS projects. We reinvest 10% of profits into the projects we depend on: FreeBSD, GhostBSD, NetBSD, Bluefin Linux, golangci-lint, and OSU Open Source Lab.</p>
