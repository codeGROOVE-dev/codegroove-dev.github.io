        <p class="about-origin-title">STARTED AT GOOGLE. FINISHED HERE.</p>
        <p class="about-origin-text">Ready to Review began as a prototype within Google's developer experience team. The triage automation concepts eventually shipped as <a href="https://github.com/google/triage-party">Triage Party</a> (4.1K stars), but the turn-based notification system—the piece that actually solves review latency—needed more than 20% time could provide. So we built it properly.</p>
