<h1>ABOUT</h1>

<div class="groove-card">

<h2>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2>

<div class="groove-card">
<p class="text-large text-bold mb-2">ENGINEERING VELOCITY IS EVERYTHING</p>
<p>Your team's ability to ship code is your competitive advantage. Every hour spent waiting for reviews is an hour not building features that matter.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>The best tools disappear into your workflow.</strong> They don't require training, onboarding, or behavior changes.</p>

<p><strong>Metrics drive decisions.</strong> We measure what matters: cycle time, review latency, and developer satisfaction. If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.</p>

<p><strong>Developer experience is business impact.</strong> Happy developers ship faster. Frustrated developers create technical debt and eventually leave.</p>

<h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2>

<p><strong>The cost of slow reviews is massive.</strong> For a 20-person team, waiting for reviews burns $1M annually in lost productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Turn-based tracking changes everything.</strong> When everyone knows exactly whose turn it is, PRs move through review 15X faster.</p>

<p><strong>Your tooling should amplify talent, not burden it.</strong> We eliminate the friction that keeps great engineers from doing great work.</p>

<h2>FOUNDER - THOMAS STROMBERG</h2>

<p>30 years in open source. Former Google, Kubernetes, Chainguard. Led engineering teams as both technical lead and manager.</p>

<p>Started codeGROOVE after being tired of being the review bottleneck one too many times.</p>
