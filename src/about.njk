            Remember the last time a tool just... worked? No 47-step setup. No fighting with configs. Just you, your code, and that sweet flow state.

            That's what we're chasing at codeGROOVE. Because after scaling datacenter automation at Google, leading teams at Equinix, and founding the security team at Chainguard, we've seen enough tool-induced suffering to last several lifetimes.

                    I've spent 30 years in open source, contributing to projects you probably use daily (Kubernetes, Firefox, FreeBSD). Built some tools too—Triage Party, malcontent—because sometimes you need to scratch your own itch.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Now I'm on a mission: help every developer ship like they're on the world's best team. No friction. No nonsense. Just pure productivity.

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Our Philosophy</h2>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-weight: 500;">
                Great tools amplify human capability without getting in the way—and we know how to build them.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                Through years of building within open-source communities, we've learned that the most powerful solutions are often the simplest ones. Complex platforms solve real problems, but they frequently create new ones: cognitive overhead, vendor lock-in, and systems so intricate that debugging becomes archaeology.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <strong>AI is fundamentally changing what small teams can accomplish.</strong> We're witnessing solo developers and tight-knit teams shipping software that rivals what large organizations produce. This isn't hype—it's happening now, and it's reshaping how we think about the tools that enable this shift.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <strong>We excel at platform diversity</strong> because we understand that innovation doesn't follow predictable paths. The next breakthrough might come from an embedded system, a forgotten language, or a community that major vendors overlook. We build tools that work across this spectrum, meeting developers in their chosen environments while optimizing for open-source workflows.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <strong>Simplicity scales, complexity breeds insecurity.</strong> Transparent architectures reveal bugs faster. Lean systems perform predictably. Fewer dependencies mean fewer vulnerabilities. This isn't ideology—it's what we've observed across thousands of projects. Many eyeballs make all bugs shallow, but only when those eyes can actually comprehend what they're seeing.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                We don't eliminate all complexity because some problems genuinely require sophisticated solutions. <strong>We eliminate unnecessary complexity</strong> and build tools that leverage your existing expertise rather than demanding you learn new paradigms just to get started.
