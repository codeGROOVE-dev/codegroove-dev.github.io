<h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">ABOUT</h1>

<div class="groove-card">
<p style="margin: 0; color: var(--black); font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">BUILT BY ENGINEERS WHO KNOW THE PAIN</p>
</div>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: -1px;">OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2>

<div class="groove-card">
<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px;">ENGINEERING VELOCITY IS EVERYTHING</p>
<p>Your team's ability to ship code is your competitive advantage. Every hour spent waiting for reviews is an hour not building features that matter.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>The best tools disappear into your workflow.</strong> They don't require training, onboarding, or behavior changes.</p>

<p><strong>Metrics drive decisions.</strong> We measure what matters: cycle time, review latency, and developer satisfaction. If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.</p>

<p><strong>Developer experience is business impact.</strong> Happy developers ship faster. Frustrated developers create technical debt and eventually leave.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: -1px;">WHY IT MATTERS</h2>

<p><strong>The cost of slow reviews is massive.</strong> For a 20-person team, waiting for reviews burns $1M annually in lost productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Turn-based tracking changes everything.</strong> When everyone knows exactly whose turn it is, PRs move through review 94% faster.</p>

<p><strong>Your tooling should amplify talent, not burden it.</strong> We eliminate the friction that keeps great engineers from doing great work.</p>
