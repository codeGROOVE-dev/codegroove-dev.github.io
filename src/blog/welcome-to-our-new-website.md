We're thrilled to unveil our brand new website! After months of development, we're excited to share what we've been working on.

## What We're Building

At codeGROOVE, we're focused on eliminating code review latency - the silent productivity killer that costs development teams countless hours every week. Our tools help teams merge pull requests in minutes instead of days.

## Meet Our Products

### Ready to Review

Our flagship product that brings intelligent PR notifications to your entire team. With smart reviewer assignments, real-time status updates, and integrations for Slack, Desktop, Web, and CLI - no PR gets forgotten.

### Review Goose

A lightweight, open-source desktop app for individual developers who need PR notifications without requiring team buy-in or special permissions.

## What's Next

We're actively working on new features and improvements based on feedback from early users. Stay tuned for:

- Enhanced timezone detection for better reviewer assignments
- Advanced PR metrics and analytics
- Integration with more communication platforms
